Problem:

The task is to process a text file to count the number of lines, sentences, and words.

    A line is defined as text that ends with an End-of-Line (EOL) character, such as \n.
    A sentence is defined as text that ends with a punctuation mark such as a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?).
    A word is defined as a sequence of characters that ends with a space, comma, period, semicolon, or similar punctuation mark.

The program should:

    Read the text from an input file.
    Count the number of lines, sentences, and words.
    Output each word found in the text.
    Write the results (number of lines, sentences, and words) to a different output file.
